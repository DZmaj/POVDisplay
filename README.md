• Five Arduino controlled RGB LEDs mounted vertically on a breadboard and rotated at a high RPM by a DC motor. As the breadboard spins, the LEDs flash in a way which "displays" words in mid-air.

• This visual illusion is known as the persistence-of-vision effect.

• Created a flashing pattern for each number and letter in the English alphabet. The length of each flash had to be timed with the speed of rotation.

• The program can take any sentence with alphanumeric characters and convert it into a sequence of light flashes which, when spun at the appropriate RPM, appear as text in the air.
